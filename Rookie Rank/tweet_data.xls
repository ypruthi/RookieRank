@wesstwestwest Because he‚Äôs not a superstar point guard anymore and playing lebron off ball doesn‚Äôt stop the fact that he still can‚Äôt make a jump shot anymore I think that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs better for him to come off the bench when lebron is off so Russ has more freedom

He also watched LeBron take teams CONSECUTIVELY to the finals with spacing and shooting and now has a roster with an all time league low 3pt shooting

"This trading LeBron &amp; AD discussion is so interesting to me, because I feel it really leans into how much we hold on even when we have to let go to get back to where we want to be. Of course, we're talking about the NBA, but seeing people reluctant to move either is fascinating."

Take the team Lebron lost to, call them great, and offer no consistency whatsoever. 

No one was calling that spurs team great before they faced the heat. The heat, including Lebron, rolled over and inflated the spurs stock."
