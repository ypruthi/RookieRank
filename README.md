# RookieRank

Have you ever wondered who's going to be the more _popular_ player, Luka Doncic or Trae Young? Well look no further!

RookieRank is a full-stack web application built using a Django REST framework, and leverages NLP and Pandas to predict the next 'face' of the NBA, using non-traditional means. 

Instead of relying on basketball performance, it relies on consumer engagement and sentiment analysis AI to find the most polarizing and high-traffic NBA prospects under the age of 25, in order to predict players who have both skills, and ability to take the limelight.

Additionally, RookieRank also has a multiplayer game functionality where multiple individuals can connect to a "RankRoom" and are continuously given 5 random players to rank based on the same criteria as mentioned above. The player who's rankings most closely match the real ranking wins after 5 rounds. 

_Note: Unfortunately, due to Twitter's API Changes as of April 4th, 2023 RookieRank is currently not working, and is currently being refactored to rely on other means to gather data. However, the source code is still available as the project continues it's rebirth!_
